    The purpose of our project is to create an area with sustainable conditions in the most difficult conditions, where people can live on other planets. 
    <br>
    With our Smart home, Greenhouse and Lake ecosystem in the Biosphere XYZ, we tend to establish a system that can meet the needs and operate without the need of human assistance.
